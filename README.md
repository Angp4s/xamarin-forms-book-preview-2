# xamarin-forms-book-preview-2
Sample code for the 2nd Preview Edition of "Creating Mobile Apps with Xamarin.Forms"

Notes
-----

As of February 9, 2015, all projects have been upgraded to Xamarin.Forms 1.3.3. 

Consequently, there is now a little difference between the version of **TextVariations** here and the one in the PDF version of Chapter 7. With version 1.3.3, there is no longer a distinction between text as the content of the `Label` tags and text as content of the `Label.Text` tags. In both cases, whitespace at the beginning and end of the text block is trimmed.  

As of March 4, 2015, all projects have been upgraded to Xamarin.Forms 1.3.5.

As of March 16, 2015, Chapters 8 through 13 have been upgraded to 1.4.0

When specifying a `local` namespace declaration in XAML, it is no longer necessary to include the assembly name. You can include it if you want, but it's been removed from the **ColorListView** program in Chapter 8, **SharedStatics** in Chapter 10, and **StackedBitmap** in Chapter 13.
