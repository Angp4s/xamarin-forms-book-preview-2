# xamarin-forms-book-preview-2
Sample code for the 2nd Preview Edition of "Creating Mobile Apps with Xamarin.Forms"

Notes
-----

As of February 9, 2015, all projects have been upgraded to Xamarin.Forms 1.3.3. 

Consequently, there is now a little difference between the version of **TextVariations** here and the one in the PDF version of Chapter 7. With version 1.3.3, there is no longer a distinction between text as the content of the `Label` tags and text as content of the `Label.Text` tags. In both cases, whitespace at the beginning and end of the text block is trimmed.
