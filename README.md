# xamarin-forms-book-preview-2
Sample code for the 2nd Preview Edition of "Creating Mobile Apps with Xamarin.Forms"

Notes
-----

The **windows-runtime** branch contains projects that have been upgraded for the Windows Runtime API in Windows Phone 8.1 and Windows 8.1. These projects are currently built with Xamarin.Forms 1.4.2.6253-pre2.

This is a prerelease version of Xamarin.Forms so not all features are working. Font sizes are somewhat erratic, the `Accent` color doesn't show up, `OnPlatform` doesn't account for the new platforms, the SAP programs in Chapter 9 won't compile, and most of the programs in Chapter 13 don't work.
